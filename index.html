                    <p>I graduated from <a class="style_link" href="https://www.unc.edu">UNC-Chapel Hill</a> in 2021
                        with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematics. During my time
                        as an undergraduate, I undertook research in Natural Language Processing under <a

                        researching methods to classify medical reports. I have also begun freelance web developer work
                        with <a class="style_link" href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/">Caktus Group</a>, including

                                        <p>At my time at Caktus group, I've been contracted on three projects. Much of the first project dealt with learning APIs for products our client was interested
                                            in incorporating into their service. To accomplish this, we had to build out the infrastructure required to query, store, and analyze the data from each product. After the technical lead was moved to another project, I took over the project and lead it
                                            to completion. The second contract I worked on involved a website upgrade from Django 1.9 to 1.11. We used Jira to track tickets, docker to
                                            manage development environments, and had to utilize and setup AWS configurations as well. My third and current contract deals with developing new features
                                            for a website, particularly improving existing education technology aspects of a website.</p>

                                            I also <a class="style_link" href="https://github.com/ByrdOfAFeather/pred_essay_quality">explored</a> various practical aspects of Natural Language Processing, including how to fine-tune large language models for down-stream classification tasks. As part of this
                                            I familiarized myself with SOTA mechanisms to interpret predictions from these large language models, including integrated gradients and LIME. I extended the most popular implementation of lime and opened a <a href="https://github.com/marcotcr/lime/pull/687" class="style_link">pull-request</a>, which
                                            adds the ability to use a T5 model to fill in blanks created in the input during the LIME process. <br></br>I'm currently exploring ways to use natural language feedback to improve models, partly inspiring my <a href="https://github.com/ByrdOfAFeather/fast-weights" class="style_link">implementation</a>
                                            of <a href="https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/814768/file.pdf" class="style_link">fast-weights</a>, in which one model (the slow-network) learns weight updates for another (the fast-network). As well, I've taken up studying a classification task in which the goal to is determine the severity of
                                            medical errors based on a description of the event.

                                        <p>As a support programmer, I maintained an existing repository, <a class="style_link" href="https://github.com/kilmoretrout/argus_gui">ARGUS</a>, which
                                            provided support for complex video analysis features such as 3D point recovery (in the case of multiple cameras), and path
                                            tracking. Given the complexity of this package, and the inconvenience of having to install Python to use it, I was also responsible with remaking ARGUS into <a class="style_link" href="https://github.com/ByrdOfAFeather/argus-web">ARGUSWEB</a> which
                                            was a significant undertaking. I had to incorporate multiple concepts from distributed systems, including inter-process (inter-tab) communication, and synchronization strategies. Much of this was further complicated by the complexities of videos - the actual process of
                                            loading a video into the browser for frame-by-frame analysis is not as straight forward as it seems. I'm personally proud of the
                                            <a class="style_link" href="https://github.com/ByrdOfAFeather/argus-web/blob/main/CLICKER/static/js/communicators_manager.js">API</a> I designed to add and remove features that needed to be synchronized, along with support for disabling
                                            some of these features. Part of this design allowed me to share code for generic video rendering methods between a "main window" and "pop out" windows (videos that have been moved into their own tab). I also designed and put together a <a class="style_link" href="https://youtu.be/Vrnr07vocXQ?t=1129"> MVP</a> for using  pre-trained computer vision models to automatically track animals within the video footage.

                                            Given the difficulty of implementation, and importance to researching animal locomotion, this software was accepted to the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology 2021, and remains
