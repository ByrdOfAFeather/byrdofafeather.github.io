            At my time at Caktus group, I've been contracted on three projects. Much of the first project dealt with learning APIs for products our client was interested
            in incorporating into their service. To accomplish this, we had to build out the infrastructure required to query, store, and analyze the data from each product. After the technical lead was moved to another project, I took over the project and lead it
            to completion. The second contract I worked on involved a website upgrade from Django 1.9 to 1.11. We used Jira to track tickets, docker to
            manage development environments, and had to utilize and setup AWS configurations as well. My third and current contract deals with developing new features
            for a website, particularly improving existing education technology aspects of the site.
